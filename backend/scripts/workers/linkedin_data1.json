        "description": "At Pylon, we\u2019re a small team building a very ambitious product in the mortgage space.At this early stage, we\u2019re looking for engineers who can see the opportunity of what we\u2019re building towards and want to have a hand in building it.We're in search of people who find difficult problems invigorating and who fit well into a high-performing team built on mutual respect and reliance. If you like pushing yourself to learn a massive amount while shipping code that has a huge impact on the end product, Pylon Engineering could be a great place for you.About YouYou:Have strong opinions that you\u2019re willing to defend. We have a culture of vigorous discussion and debate on technical decisions. We\u2019ll push you to defend your choices, and we want you to push back. Don't settle. Challenge yourself to frequently and consistently deliver exceptional code. If something could be better, take the initiative to improve it. Have great ideas, and lots of them. You should see opportunities all around you to make the code, product and infrastructure better. We\u2019ll give you an environment where you can act on those ideas. Are self-motivated. You can take a goal and drive towards it without needing extensive hand-holding. The team is supportive and loves to share knowledge and advice, but there\u2019s no time for micromanaging your work. Are comfortable with ambiguity. There's a million ways to do things; you should feel at ease making a decision under uncertainty while balancing competing constraints. Are confident you can learn quickly. Mortgage is complex, our platform is complex, good software engineering is complex. You\u2019ve got to have an attitude that you can absorb it, get on top of it, and build something better than what came before. Love strong typing. We're a team full of people who love Haskell and Rust (and Idris!) and take pride in pushing Typescript to its limits. Know SQL. We use an ORM and query builder, but it\u2019s a thin wrapper over SQL. You\u2019ve got to know SQL inside and out to really be successful. About The TeamWhat we\u2019re not:Building a CRUD app:We\u2019re building a platform that\u2019s only possible due to deep technology investments and thinking hard from first principles. Cargo-culting what\u2019s come before won\u2019t be sufficient. If you\u2019re looking to do mostly plumbing / lego piece assembling, Pylon may be very frustrating for youA machine learning / AI shop (currently):Sorry! If you\u2019re looking to do ML-heavy stuff, Pylon may not be right for you. We won\u2019t rule out any tool to solve a problem, but our current challenges aren\u2019t ones that ML is particularly suited to. An easy job:We\u2019re building a lot of things from the ground up for the first time. Working at Pylon is like a research project where you have to ship to intelligent, opinionated customers regularly. It\u2019s basically guaranteed you\u2019ll be handed a task that is too difficult for you to do. You might fail sometimes. You might have no idea where to start. Our team leans heavily on each other, but there\u2019s no getting around the difficulties. That being said, we aren\u2019t into performatively working long hours. We have a generous vacation policy and night and weekend work is the exception, not the norm. Come to work refreshed and energized and ready to get stuff done. What we are:A small team:We don\u2019t have an army of engineers. If you find something is broken, you are probably the best one to fix itAll the code we write has to punch above its weight in maintainability and toil reductionIf you have a good idea, you have much more ability to put it into action than at a large companyWe need generalists: specialization is for big companies that already have everything figured out. If you\u2019re smart, flexible and like getting into everything, we want you. Working in a regulated space:Mortgage is regulated both federally and at the state level. We move fast, but breaking things isn\u2019t an option. About The JobBasicsJob title: Software EngineerStock options: own a piece of the company and we all win togetherNo preset vacation day limitHealth insurance, dental, etc. Remote friendly: our team is spread across all 4 continental US timezones. Moving stipend if you want to move to the SF Bay Area: several of us are physically in SV, working within driving distance of each other is nice!Our technology stack:To be up front: we don\u2019t require that you\u2019ve worked with any of these technologies before. We list these mainly for you in case you don\u2019t want to work with any of these technologies. If you do .NET or Java or COBOL development and you\u2019re ok working with this stack, then we\u2019re golden.Typescript front and backendReact on the frontendGraphQL & JSON/REST APIsPostgreSQLNestJS web frameworkNx build systemAWS stack using CDK for declarative infrastructureWe currently use ECS rather than Kubernetes. If you have questions about this choice and want to know more, please apply!General philosophy: monolith until it hurts. If we can do something without introducing a new service, we willAbout PylonPylon is the first API-driven Mortgage-as-a-Service platform. We are building a set of APIs to allow companies to build mortgage services. Customers rely on us to manage a core part of their business.Pylon is partnered with financial institutions such as Bayview, Neuberger Bergman, UWM, and First American as well as backed by investors such as Conversion Capital, QED, Fifth Wall, Peter Thiel, Montage Ventures, and Village Global.Compensation Range: $150K - $200K\n\n\n        Show more\n\n        \n\n\n        Show less",

        "description": "At Pylon, we\u2019re a small team building a very ambitious product in the mortgage space.At this early stage, we\u2019re looking for engineers who can see the opportunity of what we\u2019re building towards and want to have a hand in building it.We're in search of people who find difficult problems invigorating and who fit well into a high-performing team built on mutual respect and reliance. If you like pushing yourself to learn a massive amount while shipping code that has a huge impact on the end product, Pylon Engineering could be a great place for you.About YouYou:Have strong opinions that you\u2019re willing to defend. We have a culture of vigorous discussion and debate on technical decisions. We\u2019ll push you to defend your choices, and we want you to push back. Don't settle. Challenge yourself to frequently and consistently deliver exceptional code. If something could be better, take the initiative to improve it. Have great ideas, and lots of them. You should see opportunities all around you to make the code, product and infrastructure better. We\u2019ll give you an environment where you can act on those ideas. Are self-motivated. You can take a goal and drive towards it without needing extensive hand-holding. The team is supportive and loves to share knowledge and advice, but there\u2019s no time for micromanaging your work. Are comfortable with ambiguity. There's a million ways to do things; you should feel at ease making a decision under uncertainty while balancing competing constraints. Are confident you can learn quickly. Mortgage is complex, our platform is complex, good software engineering is complex. You\u2019ve got to have an attitude that you can absorb it, get on top of it, and build something better than what came before. Love strong typing. We're a team full of people who love Haskell and Rust (and Idris!) and take pride in pushing Typescript to its limits. Know SQL. We use an ORM and query builder, but it\u2019s a thin wrapper over SQL. You\u2019ve got to know SQL inside and out to really be successful. About The TeamWhat we\u2019re not:Building a CRUD app:We\u2019re building a platform that\u2019s only possible due to deep technology investments and thinking hard from first principles. Cargo-culting what\u2019s come before won\u2019t be sufficient. If you\u2019re looking to do mostly plumbing / lego piece assembling, Pylon may be very frustrating for youA machine learning / AI shop (currently):Sorry! If you\u2019re looking to do ML-heavy stuff, Pylon may not be right for you. We won\u2019t rule out any tool to solve a problem, but our current challenges aren\u2019t ones that ML is particularly suited to. An easy job:We\u2019re building a lot of things from the ground up for the first time. Working at Pylon is like a research project where you have to ship to intelligent, opinionated customers regularly. It\u2019s basically guaranteed you\u2019ll be handed a task that is too difficult for you to do. You might fail sometimes. You might have no idea where to start. Our team leans heavily on each other, but there\u2019s no getting around the difficulties. That being said, we aren\u2019t into performatively working long hours. We have a generous vacation policy and night and weekend work is the exception, not the norm. Come to work refreshed and energized and ready to get stuff done. What we are:A small team:We don\u2019t have an army of engineers. If you find something is broken, you are probably the best one to fix itAll the code we write has to punch above its weight in maintainability and toil reductionIf you have a good idea, you have much more ability to put it into action than at a large companyWe need generalists: specialization is for big companies that already have everything figured out. If you\u2019re smart, flexible and like getting into everything, we want you. Working in a regulated space:Mortgage is regulated both federally and at the state level. We move fast, but breaking things isn\u2019t an option. About The JobBasicsJob title: Software EngineerStock options: own a piece of the company and we all win togetherNo preset vacation day limitHealth insurance, dental, etc. Remote friendly: our team is spread across all 4 continental US timezones. Moving stipend if you want to move to the SF Bay Area: several of us are physically in SV, working within driving distance of each other is nice!Our technology stack:To be up front: we don\u2019t require that you\u2019ve worked with any of these technologies before. We list these mainly for you in case you don\u2019t want to work with any of these technologies. If you do .NET or Java or COBOL development and you\u2019re ok working with this stack, then we\u2019re golden.Typescript front and backendReact on the frontendGraphQL & JSON/REST APIsPostgreSQLNestJS web frameworkNx build systemAWS stack using CDK for declarative infrastructureWe currently use ECS rather than Kubernetes. If you have questions about this choice and want to know more, please apply!General philosophy: monolith until it hurts. If we can do something without introducing a new service, we willAbout PylonPylon is the first API-driven Mortgage-as-a-Service platform. We are building a set of APIs to allow companies to build mortgage services.
