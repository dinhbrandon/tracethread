Google Jobs Scraper
-------------------

This module (or collection of modules) is tailored for scraping job-related data from Google Jobs or other Google services.

Responsibilities:
- Web Navigation: Use tools like Selenium for web automation, especially if data retrieval requires dynamic interactions or deep navigations.
- Data Extraction: Utilize libraries such as Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML and extract essential data points.
- Data Pre-processing: Cleanse and format the scraped data to ensure its readiness for subsequent processing or storage.
- Error Handling: Address potential issues that might surface during scraping, such as structural changes in the website or connectivity problems.
- Rate Limiting: Introduce pauses or delays to respect Google's rate limits and to prevent potential IP bans.
- Monitoring and Logging: Monitor the scraping process, track success metrics, and log any significant events or challenges.

Note: Always be aware of the legal and ethical implications of web scraping. Ensure compliance with Google's terms and conditions and any relevant laws or regulations.
