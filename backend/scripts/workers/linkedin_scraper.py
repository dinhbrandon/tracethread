LinkedIn Scraper
----------------

This module (or collection of modules) is dedicated to scraping job-related data from LinkedIn.

Responsibilities:
- Web Navigation: Use tools like Selenium to automate the browsing process, especially if the data requires interacting with the page or navigating through multiple pages.
- Data Extraction: Use libraries like Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content and extract relevant data.
- Data Pre-processing: Clean and preprocess the scraped data to ensure it's in a usable format.
- Error Handling: Manage potential errors that may arise during the scraping process, such as changes in the website structure or connection issues.
- Rate Limiting: Implement pauses or delays to respect LinkedIn's `robots.txt` file and avoid being IP-banned.
- Monitoring and Logging: Keep track of the data scraping process, monitor success rates, and log significant events or errors.

Note: Web scraping may involve legal and ethical considerations. Ensure you have permission and are in compliance with LinkedIn's terms of service and any applicable laws.
