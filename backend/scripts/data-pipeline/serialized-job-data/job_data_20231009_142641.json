If you want to push the frontier in developer tooling, we want to work with you.We\u2019re solving a complex and tedious problem for developers: product notification infrastructure. Companies like LinkedIn, Slack, and GitHub dedicate large engineering teams and tens of millions of dollars per year to building and maintaining the systems that power their user notifications, alerts, reminders, digests, and other programmatic communication.
