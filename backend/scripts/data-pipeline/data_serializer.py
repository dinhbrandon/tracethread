"""
Data Serializer
-------------------------

This module is responsible for converting processed data into specific formats suitable for storage, transmission, or further processing.

Responsibilities:
- Serialization: Convert complex data structures into storage/transmission-friendly formats (e.g., JSON, XML).
- Encoding: Convert data into specific encodings for compatibility or compactness (e.g., Base64, compression).
- Decoding/Deserialization: Convert serialized or encoded data back into native data structures when needed.

This component acts as an intermediary step between stream processing and data storage or transmission.
