Stream Processors
-----------------

This module is responsible for ingesting and processing data streams in real-time.

Responsibilities:
- Data Ingestion: Connect to and consume data from various real-time sources.
- Data Filtering: Remove or ignore irrelevant data based on predefined criteria.
- Data Transformation: Enrich, convert, or reformat incoming data to match desired structures or formats.
- Data Aggregation: Summarize or generate statistics from high-volume data streams over specific time windows.
- Error Handling: Ensure robust processing by handling potential errors gracefully.
- Forwarding: Send the processed data to its next destination, such as a serializer or storage system.
- Monitoring and Logging: Keep track of data ingestion rates, processing times, and other metrics, and log significant events.

Note: If processing becomes extensive, consider splitting responsibilities among multiple files within this directory.
