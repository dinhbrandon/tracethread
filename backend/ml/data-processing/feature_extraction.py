"""
Overview:
    This module is designed to extract features from the cleaned data, making it ready for machine learning tasks. 

Functions:
    - extract_text_features(text_data): Extracts features from text data, e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings.
    - encode_categorical_data(categorical_data): One-hot encodes or label encodes categorical data.
    - normalize_numerical_data(numerical_data): Normalizes numerical data to a standard scale.
    - feature_engineering(data): Creates new features based on existing ones to improve model performance.
    - ... [other functions]

Notes:
    - Ensure that the same feature extraction methods are applied consistently across training, validation, and testing datasets.
    - Be cautious of data leakage: don't use future information to extract features for current data.
    - Regularly evaluate the importance and relevance of features to the target variable.
