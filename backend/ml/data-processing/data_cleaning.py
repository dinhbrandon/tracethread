"""
Overview:
    This module contains functions and utilities to clean and preprocess the raw data obtained from the data-pipeline.

Functions:
    - remove_outliers(data): Removes outlier data points based on specified criteria.
    - handle_missing_values(data): Deals with missing data, either by removing or imputing them.
    - standardize_text_fields(data): Standardizes text fields to a common format (e.g., lowercase, removing punctuations).
    - ... [other functions]

Notes:
    - Always back up your raw data before applying cleaning operations.
    - Ensure that the cleaning operations are appropriate for the data type and distribution.
    - Cleaning operations should be consistent across training, validation, and testing datasets.
