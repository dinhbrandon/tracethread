MODELS DIRECTORY OVERVIEW

Purpose:
--------
The 'models' directory contains all the machine learning models developed for the project. This includes model definitions, training scripts, pre-trained weights, evaluation metrics, and any utilities directly related to model performance and validation.

Contents:
---------
1. model_definitions.py:
   - Contains the architecture of different machine learning models.
   - For deep learning models, you may find neural network layers, configurations, and initializations.

2. train.py:
   - Contains scripts to train the models on the dataset.
   - Includes configurations such as hyperparameters, training loops, and optimization algorithms.

3. evaluate.py:
   - Scripts to evaluate model performance on validation and test datasets.
   - Might output metrics like accuracy, F1-score, ROC curves, etc.

4. pre_trained/:
   - A directory containing pre-trained model weights or checkpoints.
   - Useful for quick deployments or fine-tuning on a new dataset.

5. utilities.py:
   - Any utility functions directly related to models, such as custom loss functions, metrics, or data loaders specific to the model's input.

Notes for Collaborators:
------------------------
- Always document any changes or new models introduced.
- Ensure reproducibility by setting random seeds and documenting software and library versions.
- Before training large models or running extensive training sessions, check for available computational resources.
- Regularly evaluate and compare models to choose the best performing one for deployment.
- Adhere to ethical practices, especially when deploying models that might impact users directly.
